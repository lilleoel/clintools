\arguments{

\item{questions}{Column names of ordered list of questions (\code{list})}

\item{scale}{name of the questionaire (\code{string})}

\description{
\code{questionaire()} is a function which calculates scores from a questionaire.
}
\details{
\subsection{PARCA-R (Parent Report of Childrenâ€™s Abilities-Revised)}{

This only calculates the scores for the 34 Non-verbal cognitive score. The questionaire needs to have 34 questions, \code{scale = "PARCA-R"}, and the following additional parameters need to be set:
\itemize{
\item \code{birthday} | The name of the column for the birthday; if children are born before 37 weeks of gestatoin it is suggested to have corrected age; and then the column should be date of term.
\item \code{date} | The name of the column for the date of when the participants went through the questionaire.
\item \code{sex} | The name of the column for the sex of the participants. Male's must be coded as \code{M} and females as \code{F}.
}

The calculation summarizes both the raw score and the standard score. As per the PARCA-R manual from 2019 and from the protocol from SafeBoosC-III follow-up study \href{https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37805539/}{Rasmussen et al. 2029} moderate-or-severe cognitive impairment is defined as < -2SD. This corresponds to a standard score below 70.
}

\subsection{CBI (Copenhagen Burnout Inventory)}{

Using the 19 questions from the CBI it will both calculate \code{score} and \code{group}.

Using setting it can either be the English version (default; \code{score = 'english'})
or the Danish version (\code{score = 'danish'}). In the English version the Likert-scale
is converted to 100, 75, 50, 25, 0. Here, no more than 3 questions may be missing
in each subscore \href{https://nfa.dk/da/Vaerktoejer/Sporgeskemaer/Sporgeskema-til-maaling-af-udbraendthed/Copenhagen-Burnout-Inventory-CBI}{English CBI}.

The groups are based on the average score:
\itemize{
\item 0-25: 'no burnout'
\item 25-50: 'light burnout'
\item 50-75: 'moderate burnout'
\item 75-100: 'severe burnout'
}

In the Danish score the questions are summed up from 0 to 4 points. Here, all questions must be answered. \href{https://nfa.dk/da/Vaerktoejer/Sporgeskemaer/Sporgeskema-til-maaling-af-udbraendthed}{Danish CBI}

The groups are based on the summed score:
\itemize{
\item 0-5: 'no burnout' (0-6 for Work-related burnout)
\item 6-11: 'light burnout' (7-13 for Work-related burnout)
\item 12-17: 'moderate burnout' (14-20 for Work-related burnout)
\item 18+: 'severe burnout' (21+ for Work-related burnout)
