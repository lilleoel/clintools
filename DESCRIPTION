Description: 
   Every research team have their own script for data management, statistics and 
   most importantly hemodynamic indices. The purpose is to standardize scripts 
   utilized in clinical research. The hemodynamic indices can be used in a long-format dataframe, 
   and add both periods of interest (trigger-periods), and delete artifacts with deleter-files. 
   Transfer function analysis (Claassen et al. (2016) <doi:10.1177/0271678X15626425>) and
